# MANDATORY: Ralph Global Configuration

You MUST use skills instead of writing manual implementations when available.

## Project Context

- **Project**: Notion Docusaurus Sync
- **Purpose**: Sync Notion databases with Docusaurus markdown content
- **Tech Stack**: Node.js/TypeScript (TBD during spec phase)
- **Build Command**: TBD
- **Test Command**: TBD

## Required Skills by Task Type

No project-specific skills exist yet. As the project develops, this file
should be updated with skill mappings.

## Conventions

- Always read CLAUDE.md before starting work
- Commit after each successful task with message: "Ralph: T### - <description>"
- Run build/test verification before marking task complete
- Read the constitution at .specify/memory/constitution.md for project principles

## If No Skill Exists

Write manual code following patterns established in the codebase and constitution.
